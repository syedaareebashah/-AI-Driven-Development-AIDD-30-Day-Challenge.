#### 🔹 What is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) framework designed to replace unstructured "vibe coding" with a disciplined, AI-guided workflow. It uses a series of slash commands to enforce a strict progression from high-level rules to granular code execution, ensuring AI outputs are consistent, maintainable, and aligned with project requirements.

### Core Concepts

***1️⃣ /constitution:***

This command establishes the project's non-negotiable "DNA," defining the technology stack, coding standards, and behavioral rules. It acts as the global context and governing law that the AI must strictly adhere to throughout the entire development lifecycle.

***2️⃣ /specify:***

This command focuses strictly on the "What" and "Why" by generating a detailed requirements document (spec.md) containing user stories and acceptance criteria. It deliberately avoids technical details to ensure the focus remains on user value and high-level intent.

***3️⃣ /plan:*** 

This command transitions the project to the "How" by analyzing specifications to create a comprehensive technical blueprint (plan.md). It details the file structure, data models, APIs, and logic flow required to support the features defined in the specification phase.

***4️⃣ /tasks:*** 

This command breaks down the technical plan into a sequential checklist of granular, actionable units of work (tasks.md). By isolating specific steps, it allows the AI to execute complex features methodically rather than attempting to generate the entire codebase at once.

***5️⃣ /implement:***

This is the execution phase where the AI writes the actual code and tests by strictly following the checklist created in the /tasks phase. It synthesizes the context from the Constitution, Spec, and Plan to generate accurate and functional code.
